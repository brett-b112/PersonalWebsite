                Today was the second day of my internship at Netsmart as a software engineer intern (future). It has been an awesome experience to
                have my first real job/intern experience and see some enterprise level software. I am excited to dive deeper into the software and learn
                more about what it is like working on an swe team in industry.

                I have been making progress on the modernC textbook to learn C. I had a lot of fun 
                in New York City visiting China Town, Central Park, The Statue of Liberty, Natural History 
                Museum, 9/11 Memorial, and the Oculus. I visited for a wedding, congratulations James and Jenny!!
                I'm hoping to work through 'Prove It! A structured approach' and hopefully learn some DiffEq as 
                well I am very excited for what the future holds.

                There has been a number of things that have impacted my values and point of view on what I should puruse in life 
                and how I should do it. I will attempt to list them here it here.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                Buddhism holds four noble truths <b> be it suffering exists; it has a cause;
                it has an end; and it has a cause to bring about its end;</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                The greeks had a word <b><i>'eudaimonia'</i></b> which  holds core tenants 
                such that you take responsibility, live with virtue, and only focus on what you can control.
                <br>
                <br>
                The ideology of <b>stoicism </b>teaches that virtue (the highest good) is based on knowledge. That one must live with reason; one must be 
                be in harmony with the fate that governs nature; one must be indifferent to misfortune of any form

                Phil Stutz is a therapist that was featured in the documentary <i>Stutz</i> on Netflix.
                He speaks on topics:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Reality</b></li>
                        <ul style="margin-left:2em;"> 
                            <li>There are three givens in life <b>pain, uncertainty, and constant work</b> </li>
                            <li> <b>Life Force:</b> You have a life force which working on improves your life. A pyramid with your body as the base, then your relationships with others in the middle,
                            and your relationship with yourself at the top.</li>
                            <li> <b>Part X:</b> If you’ve embraced the Aspects of Reality and are getting better at working on your Life Force, it doesn’t mean the work is easy, especially when judgment, adversity and punishing circumstances can trigger a darker side of your psyche to appear. Stutz calls this darkness Part X, and describes it as “an invisible force that keeps you from changing.” Imagine Part X as the villain on the journey of your evolution as a human. What does your Part X say to you?</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><b>Tools</b></li>
                        <ul style="margin-left:2em;"> 
                            <li><b>String of Pearls</b> n Stutz’s illustration, each circle or “pearl” is an action — and, since each pearl is a similar size, you can think of each action having the same value, no matter what it is. This means that every large or small action in your life (brushing your teeth, deciding to end a relationship) is just that: a thing to do. You are the only person who can put the next pearl on the string. But, within each pearl is a dark spot (Stutz calls it a “turd”), which is a reminder that no effort you make will be perfect. The key is to acknowledge that and keep adding to the string anyway.</li>
                            <li><b>The Shadow:</b> According to Stutz, the Shadow is the part of yourself you’re ashamed of — the part of you that you wish didn’t exist. Stutz says to talk to your Shadow, ask it how it feels about you and ask it how it feels to be denied or avoided. In order to work with the Shadow, Stutz says you have to be able to visualize  it, honor it and engage with it. The Shadow and Part X aren’t quite the same: Think of Part X as your doubts and deepest fears, and the Shadow as the by-product of believing whatever Part X tells you.</li>
                            <li><b>The Snapshot/The Realm of Illusion: </b>Most people are on a constant hunt for the perfect experience: the perfect partner, the perfect amount of money, the perfect level of success. Stutz says that thinking of life in this way resembles a snapshot, or a frozen moment that has no movement, dynamism or depth. Though people think the perfect life exists within that snapshot, it doesn’t mesh with Stutz’s Aspects of Reality — and remember, those are unavoidable for everyone. </li>
                            <li><b>The Maze:</b> Most people are on a constant hunt for the perfect experience: the perfect partner, the perfect amount of money, the perfect level of success. Stutz says that thinking of life in this way resembles a snapshot, or a frozen moment that has no movement, dynamism or depth. Though people think the perfect life exists within that snapshot, it doesn’t mesh with Stutz’s Aspects of Reality — and remember, those are unavoidable for everyone. </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li><b>The Work</b></li>
                        <ul style="margin-left:2em;"> 
                            <li><b>Active Love: </b>Most people are on a constant hunt for the perfect experience: the perfect partner, the perfect amount of money, the perfect level of success. Stutz says that thinking of life in this way resembles a snapshot, or a frozen moment that has no movement, dynamism or depth. Though people think the perfect life exists within that snapshot, it doesn’t mesh with Stutz’s Aspects of Reality — and remember, those are unavoidable for everyone.</li>
                            <li><b>Radical Acceptance: </b>Most people are on a constant hunt for the perfect experience: the perfect partner, the perfect amount of money, the perfect level of success. Stutz says that thinking of life in this way resembles a snapshot, or a frozen moment that has no movement, dynamism or depth. Though people think the perfect life exists within that snapshot, it doesn’t mesh with Stutz’s Aspects of Reality — and remember, those are unavoidable for everyone. </li>
                            <li><b>The Grateful Flow: </b>Most people are on a constant hunt for the perfect experience: the perfect partner, the perfect amount of money, the perfect level of success. Stutz says that thinking of life in this way resembles a snapshot, or a frozen moment that has no movement, dynamism or depth. Though people think the perfect life exists within that snapshot, it doesn’t mesh with Stutz’s Aspects of Reality — and remember, those are unavoidable for everyone. </li>
                            <li><b>Loss Processing: </b>Most people are on a constant hunt for the perfect experience: the perfect partner, the perfect amount of money, the perfect level of success. Stutz says that thinking of life in this way resembles a snapshot, or a frozen moment that has no movement, dynamism or depth. Though people think the perfect life exists within that snapshot, it doesn’t mesh with Stutz’s Aspects of Reality — and remember, those are unavoidable for everyone. </li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>
                Another piece of media that has impacted me greatly is the book <b>Tuesdays with Morrie</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                Morrie talked about the tension of opposites that pulls in both directions oftentimes with everytime we make a decision.
                We want to do one thing but either equally want to do something else or fear of and outcome, which is a common feeling.
                <br>
                Additionally, he preaches the importance of livingin the present, giving back to others, forgiving, and loving and empathizing with others.

                I have been feeling lately that I am in a rut. I am leaning towards pursuing a PhD however, I am still
                scared if maybe that isn't the right choice. I am also considering entrepreneurship and industry. 
                I have not been productive as of late and have been wasting a lot of time and feeling unhappy with myself. 
                I have gotten into running which has helped but utilizing my time better and incorporating the topics above will 
                help me to have a better grasp on what's truly meaningful to me.
